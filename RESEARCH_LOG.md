WESAD EDA Pipeline
- tonic/phasic extraction
- 17 total subjects, 15 processed -- S1 wasn't included and S12 was missing?

83.6% raw, 80.2% balanced LOSO acc

Notes:
- subjects 4 and 15 had 100% balanced accuracy -- verified not majority class artifact
- subject 14 had 50% balanced accuracy
- high inter-subject variance so probably will need to calibrate something

## 5-2-2026
Multimodal features
- HRV features derived from BVP signals
- accelerometer features

81.1% raw, 78.0% balanced LOSO acc

Notes:
- multimodal is worse which means EDA-only is probably a better model
- BUT maybe will be useful for distraction data but idk
